    "\n",
    "Pinch analysis is a methodology for systematically finding optimum energy targets for a chemical plant. It analyses thermodynamically feasible maximum energy recovery (MER) targets for the available streams in a given plant, achieving them by optimising heat exchanger networks, energy supply methods and process operating conditions (Kemp, Ian, _Pinch Analysis and Process Integration, 2nd Edition_, 2016).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is based on the idea that all streams in a chemical plant can be combined based on their temperature intervals into _composite curves_: one for the hot streams (the ones that lose heat) and one for the cold streams (the ones that gain heat). These composite curves provide insight into the point of closest approach (the _pinch point_) and the intervals available for heat exchange. Hence the required extra heating and cooling utilities can be found.\n",
